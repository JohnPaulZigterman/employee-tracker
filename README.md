# Employee Tracker - John Zigterman

## Description

- The goal was to create an intuitive and easy to use employee tracker with node.js and inquirer.
- This application allows the user to view and add departments, roles, and employees. It also allows for role reassignment.
- The user is given a basic menu system that is simple to navigate and clearly outlines the functionality of the app.
- The database is directly queried using mysql queries implemented directly in index.js.
- This app would be very easy to expand in the future for other applications or to implement more specific features.

## Installation

This is a node.js application and requires the user to use node and to install inquirer for the prompts to function. The user must also initialize the database using the schema.sql and seeds.sql files found in the 'db' directory.

## Usage

In order to use the program, the user must follow all installation instructions and then type either 'npm start' or 'node index.js' in the console to run the application. From there they must simply navigate menus and follow prompts to achieve the desired results.

## Credits

I, John Paul Zigterman, completed this project by myself with the aid of the resources provided to me by the MSU coding bootcamp.
